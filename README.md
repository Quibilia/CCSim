# CCSim
Compact Country Simulator; A teensy tiny little experimental Lua script that simulates international relations.

Still heavily in refinement. Definitely should be taken with a grain of salt at this point.

Long and short: Run the script, answer the prompts, and in response to "Data > " you may type "random" or give the name of a text file with country data in it. See (or use) monarchies.txt for an example of the required format.

Side note: If you have a Linux system, I highly recommend using the custom interpreter (TREPL) bundled with the Torch project (https://github.com/torch/torch7). Simply having the libraries installed via Torch will reduce runtime of this script as drastically as minutes to seconds.
